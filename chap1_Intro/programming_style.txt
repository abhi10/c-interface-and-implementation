Conventions for C:
> Consistent convention of naming variables

Variable names are declared near their first use or in chuncks
Locals are declared at the beginning of compound statment in which they are used, when possible.

Naming convention for procedures and functions:
reflect what the prodecures do and what the function returns.

getword -> returns next word
doubleword -> find and announces words that occur two or more times

Comments :
used to explain details of data structure
Exception conditions

Literate programming encourages:
accuracy
precision
clarity

idiomatic C example:

char *strcpy(char *dst, const char *src){
	char *s = dst;
	while (*dst++ = *src++)
		;
	return s;
}


EFFICIENCY:


A program only needs to be fast enough.

Tuning program introduces error, makes it bigger.
Reliability is more important than efficiency.
